Purpose
=======

Provides workarounds and fixes to allow using ``FileCollections`` in your models.

Implements a missing domain model (CategoryBasedFileCollection), provides the necessary TypoScript to make Extbases'
internal objects actually be used and applies a fix for an invalid annotation on the TYPO3 CMS Core.



Warning
=======

This is mostly "internal" software. It even makes assumptions on files that the TYPO3 CMS Core ships as experimental or
internal. Its sole purpose is to *make it work(TM)* **quickly**.



Thanks
======

The TYPO3 community for putting so much effort into developing, managing and sharing a great product.
